Currently I am looking for people to collaborate with, so feel free to contact me and say hi if you are interested in that.</p><p>How did I get to where I am today?<br>Well it all started some years ago after graduating from <a href="http://www.htl-salzburg.ac.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTL Salzburg</a>. I was ready to change the world!<br>...but felt like I still lacked the skills needed to do so. After about a year of teaching myself the basics of web development whenever I had free time I was ready for the next step.<br>So I joined the amazing guys at <a href="https://www.salzburg-digital.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salzburg Digital</a>. I learned a lot there and this time will always have a special place in my heart. But it was time to move on and reach even higher peaks. If you are like me and believe that creativity and a healthy bit of chaos can make the world a better place (or at least a more interesting one) I would love to hear from you!</p><br><h2>EXPERIENCE</h2><p>So far I have 4 years of professional web development experience and really enjoyed that time.<br>3 years as a Junior Developer working with Wordpress, a bit of Typo3, MySQL Databases and Javascript / SCSS for the Frontend. After that, 1 year fully focusing on Frontend only, using React as a framework.</p><br><div class="tech"><h2>TECHNOLOGIES I WORKED WITH</h2><ul><li><span>React</span>, Vue, Angular</li><li><span>NextJS</span>, NuxtJS</li><li><span>GSAP, Framer Motion, Scrollmagic</span></li><li><span>Tailwind</span>, Bootstrap, Materialize</li><li><span>Webpack</span>, Gulp</li><li>Javascript, <span>Typescript, NodeJS</span>, PHP, C++</li><li><span>Github Pages, Netlify</span>, Shared Hosting</li><li><span>VSCode</span>, Atom, Brackets</li><li><span>Windows, macOS</span></li></ul><button type="button">Check out which tech I currently prefer</button></div></section><section class="skills1" id="skills"><h2>SKILLS</h2></section><section class="skills2"><ul><li>ES6 / React</li><li>CSS3 / SCSS</li><li style="line-height: 1.1">Page Optimization<br/><span style="font-size: .7em; color: lightgray">SEO, Performance, A11y</span></li><li>PHP</li><li>Wordpress / Typo3</li><li>Databases (MySQL)</li></ul></section><section class="hire-me" id="hire-me"><h2>When are we a good fit?</h2><p>I specifically look for likeminded people with a vision for a more creative and innovative digital landscape and an opportunity to create cool stuff on the web together.
